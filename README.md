Project Description: Contact Management System

The Contact Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage and organize personal or professional contact information efficiently. Users can perform the following operations:

1. Add Contacts:** Add new contacts with unique phone numbers to avoid duplicates.
2. View All Contacts: Display a list of all saved contacts.
3. Search Contacts: Search for specific contacts by their phone number and view their details.
4. Remove Contacts: Delete a contact by searching for its phone number.
5. Save and Load: Contacts are stored in a CSV file for persistent storage, allowing data to be reloaded when the program restarts.

The system ensures data integrity through:
- Unique phone numbers.
- Validation for malformed input.

This project is simple, scalable, and serves as a practical tool for organizing contacts.
